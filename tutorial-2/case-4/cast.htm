      <h1>Characters from the Tempest</h1>

      <dl>
        <dt>Prospero</dt>
        <dd>The play's protagonist and Miranda's father. Usurped and exiled by his brother Antonio, the duke of Milan.</dd><br />


        <dt>Miranda</dt>
        <dd>Prospero's daughter, whom he brought with him to the island when she was still a small child. Miranda has never seen any men other than her father and Caliban.</dd><br />


        <dt>Ariel</dt>
        <dd>Prospero's spirit helper, a powerful supernatural being whom Prospero controls completely. Rescued by Prospero from a long imprisonment (within a tree) at the hands of the witch Sycorax.</dd><br />


        <dt>Caliban</dt>
        <dd>Another of Prospero's servants. Caliban, the son of the now-deceased witch Sycorax, acquainted Prospero with the island when Prospero arrived.</dd><br />


        <dt>Ferdinand</dt>
        <dd>Son and heir of Alonso, the King of Naples. He falls in love with Miranda and happily submits to servitude in order to win her father's approval.</dd><br />


        <dt>Alonso</dt>
        <dd>King of Naples and father of Ferdinand. Alonso aided Antonio in unseating Prospero as duke of Milan twelve years earlier.</dd><br />


        <dt>Antonio</dt>
        <dd>Prospero's thoroughly wicked brother who betrayed Prospero's trust and stole his dukedom years before the play begins.</dd><br />


        <dt>Sebastian</dt>
        <dd>Alonso's brother. Like Antonio, Sebastian is wicked and underhanded.</dd><br />


        <dt>Gonzalo</dt>
        <dd>An old, honest lord. The goodhearted Gonzalo helped Prospero and Miranda to escape and survive after Antonio usurped Prospero's title.</dd><br />


        <dt>Trinculo</dt>
        <dd>A jester, who provides comic relief along with Stefano.</dd><br />


        <dt>Stefano</dt>
        <dd>A drunken butler who provides comic relief along with Trinculo.</dd><br />


        <dt>Adrian</dt>
